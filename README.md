# Tic Tac Toe - Play Against Bot

This is a Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against a computer bot. The game board is represented by a 3x3 square grid. The player uses "X" and the bot uses "O". The objective is to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player or bot to achieve this wins the game.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, the player chooses "X".
2. Players take turns placing their marks in an empty cell on the board.
3. When it's the player's turn, they select an empty cell to place their "X" mark.
4. After the player makes a move, the bot selects a random empty cell to place its "O" mark.
5. The game continues until either the player or the bot aligns three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the board is full resulting in a tie.

## Rules

- Each player takes turns placing their marks in an empty cell on the board.
- The player's mark is "X", and the bot's mark is "O".
- The player and the bot alternate turns.
- The first player or bot to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If the board is full and no player or bot has aligned three marks, the game ends in a tie.
